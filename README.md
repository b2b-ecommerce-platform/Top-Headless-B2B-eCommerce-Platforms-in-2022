# Top Headless B2B eCommerce Platforms in 2022

[Headless commerce](https://virtocommerce.com/headless-ecommerce) is an illustration of how ecommerce development influences technologies to fit the needs of the sector.

When mobile apps, messengers, and chatbots hit the market, it became critical to maintain pricing, product catalogs, and the rest of the information across each sales channel. This is how omnichannel appeared when the consumer was able to begin the purchase process on the website and continue in the mobile app. Developers were horrified to keep all this information in sync across various channels. It quickly became obvious that simultaneous support of various interfaces was possible only if separating the different variations of the front end from the single back end.

This is how "headless" was born in the software development vocab. In the developers' slang, "heads" means front-end, while "body" is the bulk of the back-end.

Before we get into choosing the best headless ecommerce platforms in 2022, let's clarify what "headless" means.

If you separate the front-end from the body in the code, it becomes "headless." To post desired content to a channel in a headless architecture, the front end communicates with the back end via an API. The headless ecommerce API is the glue that sticks a back end to any of the front ends.
